						<h2>High Performance Computing</h2>
						<p><b>(CS480F)</b> This course covers the applied area of high performance computing for machine learning, big data, and scientific computing. Students will learn about techniques for programs where the amount of computation is substantial enough that performance is a major concern. A substantial part of the material will cover parallel computation, including message-passing, multicore, and vectorization. A variety of different algorithms and applications will be considered, including machine learning, big data, and more traditional scientific computing.</p>
